When comparing two things, humans are adept at recognizing similarities and differences. However, for computers, comparing similarities between objects requires a mathematical approach. In general, the more similar two objects are, the greater the amount of commonality between them. This commonality can be measured as a distance or similarity score, which can be used to quantify the degree of similarity between the two objects.

# Manhattan distance

$d((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = \left| x_1 - x_2 \right| + \left| y_1 - y_2 \right|$
